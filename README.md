# sql-challenge

Background

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. 

This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
The ERD diagram is the data modeling component. 

The data creation schema is the data engineering component.

The data analysis compoenent is in the queries.

The project was completed by Lan Trinh as part of the module 9 challenge of University of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies Data Analytics Bootcamp
Data was generated by Mockaroo, LLC Links to an external site., (2022). Realistic Data Generator.
